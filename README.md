## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
The top three contributors towards the demand of bike are:
1. light snow and rain has negative corelation,
2. temp(temperature) has positive corelation,
3. yr(Year) has positive corelation

## Technologies Used
numpy 
pandas 
matplotlib ,
plotly 
seaborn 
statsmodels
sklearn
python 3.0
Jupiter Notebook
